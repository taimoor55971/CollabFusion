# Workplace Collaboration Tools

Welcome to the Workplace Collaboration Tools documentation! This project aims to provide an extensive set of features for team collaboration, calendar management, task management, sprints, document management, video conferences, and reporting & analytics. It's built using Nest.js and TypeScript to ensure a robust and scalable backend.

## Features

### 1. Team Collaboration

Efficiently collaborate with your team members in real-time. Share ideas, files, and updates to keep everyone on the same page.

- **Real-time Messaging:** Implement a real-time messaging system using WebSockets. Users should be able to create chat rooms or direct message each other. Implement message persistence for users to view previous conversations.

- **File Sharing:** Develop a secure file storage and sharing system with access controls and versioning. Allow users to preview common file formats directly in the application.

- **Activity Feeds:** Implement an activity feed that displays recent updates, such as file uploads, comments, task completions, and event additions. Users should be able to filter the feed by project, team, or date range.

- **@Mentions and Notifications:** Enable @mentions to notify specific users in messages or comments. Implement real-time notifications for mentions, file updates, and important events.

### 2. Calendar Management

Manage your team's schedules seamlessly. Keep track of important events, meetings, and deadlines with a user-friendly calendar.

- **Event Creation:** Build a flexible event creation system with reminders and participant invitations. Allow users to set event types (e.g., meeting, deadline, milestone) and categorize events.

- **Calendar Integration:** Provide integration with popular calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook). Allow users to import external events and export internal events to their preferred calendar tools.

- **Shared Calendars:** Enable users to create shared calendars for specific projects or teams. Implement color coding and customizable views for easy differentiation of events.

- **Conflicts and Availability:** Implement conflict detection to avoid overlapping events. Display user availability when scheduling meetings, helping teams find suitable time slots.

### 3. Task Management

Organize tasks and streamline workflows. Assign tasks, set priorities, and track progress to boost productivity.

- **Task Creation and Assignment:** Design an intuitive interface for creating tasks, assigning them, and setting due dates. Allow users to add descriptions, labels, and attachments to tasks.

- **Task Status Tracking:** Implement a status tracking mechanism with visual progress indicators. Allow users to filter and sort tasks based on status, priority, or due date.

- **Task Dependencies:** Allow users to define task dependencies, indicating which tasks must be completed before others can start. Visualize task dependencies in task lists and kanban boards.

- **Task Comments and Collaboration:** Enable users to add comments, tag team members, and discuss tasks within the platform. Provide rich text editing and mention support in task comments.

### 4. Sprints

Plan and execute sprints to achieve project goals. Define sprint duration, backlog items, and monitor sprint progress.

- **Sprint Planning:** Build a sprint planning module, allowing product owners to create sprints, specify start and end dates, and select backlog items to include in the sprint.

- **Backlog Management:** Implement a backlog where product owners and teams can add, prioritize, and estimate user stories or tasks. Allow them to move backlog items into sprints, assign owners, and track progress.

- **Sprint Velocity and Estimations:** Enable teams to estimate the effort required for each task or user story. Track sprint velocity over time to help with future planning.

- **Sprint Review and Retrospective:** Provide a mechanism for sprint review, where teams can showcase completed work, and a retrospective, where teams can discuss what went well and what can be improved.

### 5. Document Management

Centralize your documents for easy access and collaboration. Store, share, and edit documents within the platform.

- **Document Storage:** Implement a document storage system where users can upload various file types (e.g., documents, spreadsheets, presentations). Store the documents securely and provide advanced search capabilities.

- **Collaborative Editing:** Integrate a collaborative document editing feature using tools like the Google Docs API or similar solutions. Allow multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously, with real-time synchronization.

- **Version Control:** Implement version control for documents. Keep track of document revisions, allow users to roll back to previous versions, and provide detailed version history.

- **Document Templates:** Enable users to create document templates for common use cases. Implement a template library with customizable templates for documents such as meeting agendas, project proposals, and reports.

### 6. Video Conferences

Conduct virtual meetings with integrated video conferencing. Connect with team members no matter where they are.

- **Video Conferencing Integration:** Choose a video conferencing solution to integrate into the platform. Popular options include Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or open-source solutions like Jitsi or WebRTC-based implementations.

- **Meeting Scheduling:** Allow users to schedule video conferences directly within the platform. Provide options to invite participants, set meeting agendas, and specify the conferencing tool to be used.

- **Real-time Collaboration:** During video conferences, provide collaborative features such as screen sharing, interactive whiteboards, and real-time document editing. These features enhance the meeting experience and facilitate effective communication.

- **Recording and Playback:** Implement the ability to record video conferences and save them for future reference. Allow users to playback recorded meetings within the platform.

### 7. Reporting and Analytics

Gain insights into your team's performance. Generate reports and analyze data to make informed decisions.

- **Data Collection:** Collect relevant data from each module (collaboration, calendar, tasks, sprints, documents, video conferences). Store this data in a structured manner for analysis.

- **Analytics Dashboard:** Build a comprehensive analytics dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) for teams and projects. Allow users to customize and save dashboards with different widgets and data visualizations.

- **Custom Reports:** Provide a report generation tool that allows users to create custom reports based on selected parameters, such as team productivity, task completion rates, event attendance, and document usage.

## Authentication and Authorization

Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are crucial for the security and privacy of your Workplace Collaboration Tools. Here's how you can implement these features:

### 1. Authentication

- **User Registration:** Implement a user registration API where new users can sign up by providing their email address, username, and password.

- **User Login:** Create a secure login system. Users should be able to authenticate using their registered email and password.

- **Password Hashing:** Store user passwords securely by hashing them using a strong cryptographic hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).

- **Token-Based Authentication:** Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. When users log in successfully, issue a JWT that contains user information and expiration time.

- **Token Refresh:** Implement a token refresh mechanism.

- **Password Reset:** Provide a password reset mechanism that sends a secure link to the user's email to reset their password in case they forget it.

### 2. Authorization

- **Roles and Permissions:** Define roles (e.g., admin, regular user) and permissions (e.g., read, write) for different parts of the application.

- **Middleware:** Create middleware functions that check the user's role and permissions before allowing access to certain API routes or actions.

- **Owner-Based Authorization:** For resources that are owned by users (e.g., tasks, documents), implement owner-based authorization.

- **Admin Privileges:** Implement an admin role with elevated privileges.
